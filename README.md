# PyBer_Analysis

## Challenge
### Part 1
In this analysis, PyBer summary DataFrame generated. Total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fapre per ride and average fare per driver were shown for the three city types, rural, suburban and urban. While the total number of rides or total number of drivers were extensively higher for urban cities, the average fare per ride was less variable among the city types. Despite the small difference, urban cities had less average fare per ride followed by suburban and rural cities. 

The average fare per driver was more dramatically different among the city types. The drivers in the urban cities had less average fare amount compared to the drivers in the suburban and rural cities. The average fare per driver in the rural cities were more than three times of that for urban cities. This could possibly be due to the distance of ride being further in rural cities. Also, there are more competition among drivers in the urban cities compared to suburban or rural cities that can lead to lower average fare per driver.

### Part 2
In this analysis,sum of the fares for each city type was plotted. As shown in the Fig_Challenge.png figure, the total fares per each week are shown for the dates from Jan 2019 to Apr 2019. The line chart clearly shows that urban cities have larger amount of total fare than suburban and rural cities. The total fare for each month turns out to have very subtle variance throughout the months plotted, indicating that time of the year does not influence ride-sharing.
